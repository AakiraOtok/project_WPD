ABSTRACT = {Although detecting small objects is critical in various applications, neural network models designed and trained for generic object detection struggle to do so with precision. For example, the popular Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) tends to perform poorly for small objects, and balancing the performance of SSD across different sized objects remains challenging. In this study, we argue that the current IoU-based matching strategy used in SSD reduces the training efficiency for small objects due to improper matches between default boxes and ground truth objects. To address this issue and improve the performance of SSD in detecting small objects, we propose a new matching strategy called aligned matching that considers aspect ratios and center-point distance in addition to IoU. The results of experiments on the TT100K and Pascal VOC datasets show that SSD with aligned matching detected small objects significantly better without sacrificing performance on large objects or requiring extra parameters.},
